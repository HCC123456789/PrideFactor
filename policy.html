            <br><br>
            <span style="font-weight:600;">What are cookies and how are they used?</span>
            <br>
            1.	Cookies are pieces of information a web site transfers to a user’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make surfing the web easier for you by saving your preferences and tracking your online habits, traffic patterns, and making sure you do not see the same advertisement too often. The use of cookies is an industry standard.
            <br>
            2.	We may place a “cookie” on your browser to store and sometimes track information about you.
            <br>
            3.	While most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please, note that some parts of the web site will not function properly if you refuse cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from third party advertisers. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party advertisers is an industry standard.
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight:600;">Use of IP Address</span>
            <br>
            1.	An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer whenever it is connected to the Internet.  We also log IP addresses, or the location of computers on the Internet.  We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of the web site. We do not ordinarily link IP addresses to personal information, which means that your session may remain anonymous. However, we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. For example, it may be necessary to identify a particular user when it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Terms and Conditions or to protect our service web site, customers or other interests.
            <br><br>
           <span style="font-weight:600;"> Security</span>
            <br>
            1.	The importance of security for all personal information associated with you is of the utmost concern to us. While we exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to, or from our web site.
            <br><br>
            <span style="font-weight:600;">E-Mail</span>
            <br>
            1.	We may periodically send e-mails to you about services, products or promotions offered by us and our advertisers to the e-mail address provided by you.
